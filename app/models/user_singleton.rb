# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24927928/singleton-in-scope-of-a-request-in-rails
# Since each request is tied to a thread, we are storing user info in the thread local store
# as a singleton.   Cmr.rb is called from models, controllers, helpers, etc.
# It would take a major refactoring to make the User info available at all these layers.
# Ideally, we would need some kind of Environment object which is passed down through.
# That is essentially what the thread local store is providing us.   But it would be better
# to refactor Cmr.rb and really think about all the interactions with it.
